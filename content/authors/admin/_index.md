The website is under construction. As of now, not all information is accurate, and some reflects the content of the original template.

I am a UChicago- and Harvard-trained economist with international background and exceptional skills in data analysis, data science, data visualization, and economic research.

I believe that data-driven research is a power for good. I seek to join projects that have a positive impact - starting with a single organization and eventually reaching the common good of all.
