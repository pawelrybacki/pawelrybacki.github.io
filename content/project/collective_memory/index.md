My CS50 project is a website where everyone can share their impressions from living in a particular place and time.

Conceptually, this is a project that allows people to share the stories of from their lives or the lives of their relatives. The goal is to save the memories that reflect what people think, feel, observe, say, and not say, in a given place and time. Everyone can read and share stories. This is may sound similar to a blog, and in some ways it is a blog. However, the ambition of the project is collect these memories into one place from which the future generations can take. This is like an encyclopedia for the kind of information a regular encyclopedia won't tell you.

Technically, this is a website application running on Python's Flask. The sourcecode is in HTML, CSS, Markdown (when a user adds their posts), Jinja, JavaScript, and Python. It's organized as package, and the script to run it is called `app.py`. The most important parts of this website's functionality are based on Flask's modules.
