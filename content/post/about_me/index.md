## Me and My Story

As a Polish high school student in Bydgoszcz, Poland, I hardly realized that studying in the United States was a possibility. This changed when I met a Dominican brother from New York on a German language course in Austria and learned about financial aid opportunities for international students at American institutions. 

Formerly pursuing biology and chemistry, I developed my passion for the scientific method and found its fulfillment in empirical social science studies. In my interdisciplinary social scientific research, I have focused on financial technology, economic development, culture, behavior, and religion. 

My economics senior thesis quantifed economically significant cultural disparities in behavior across the former 19th-century Prussian-Russian border in contemporary Poland by utilizing a spatial regression discontinuity design and a novel Partitions of Poland Survey of 3150 respondents. 

I'm a member of Harvard College Class of 2021 and University of Chicago Graduate Class of 2022. I am a Student Fellow at the Abigail Adams Institute. I'm also an alumn of the Abigail Adams Institute, the John Adams Society, Harvard Political Review,  Kenneth I. Juster Fellowship, and the Weatherhead Center.

In my free time, I like to philosophize on life and the nature of all things. I have a penchant for the Italian language, pre-modern Western philosophy, and Renaissance art.
