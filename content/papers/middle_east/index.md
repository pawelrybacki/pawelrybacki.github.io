summary: I argue that today's poor economic performance of the Middle Eastern countries relative to Western countries results from their adverse geography and, more importantly, the rigidity of their traditional Islamic institutions. I emphasize that it was not any particular type of institution that was decisive in hampering growth, but rather the lack of institutional transformation comparable to that of medieval Europe. To shed more light on this issue, I discuss how Islamic institutions prevented the development of law, science, and decentralized power structures.

Between the tenth and the thirteenth centuries, the Middle East was surpassed by Europe in terms of economic development. The emergent gap has persisted to this day. Why the Middle East has lost its initial prominence is a difficult question that remains a topic of debate in historical studies and development economics. Therefore, a suggested answer should be multifaceted. 

I argue that today's poor economic performance of the Middle Eastern countries relative to Western countries results from their adverse geography and, more importantly, the rigidity of their traditional Islamic institutions. I emphasize that it was not any particular type of institution that was decisive in hampering growth, but rather the lack of institutional transformation comparable to that of medieval Europe. To shed more light on this issue, I discuss how Islamic institutions prevented the development of law, science, and decentralized power structures.

Before reaching this conclusion, the <a href="middle_east.pdf">paper</a> navigates through several broad but crucial aspects of the problem of development. First, it clarifies that the economic decline of the Middle East occurred both in relation to its past prosperity and in relation to thriving Europe. Second, it describes what geographic obstacles put the Middle East in a disadvantageous position relative to Europe. It then discusses key differences in the economic institutions of these two regions and proceeds to explain what caused the dissimilarity in dynamics of institutional transformation. Finally, it posits that both Islam and its traditional interpretation lie beneath the rigidity of traditional Islamic institutions.
